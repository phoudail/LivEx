# LivEx (Live Examples eXpression)

This repository features LivEx, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) built with [Langium](https://langium.org/) intended to provide an expressive and language-agnostic way of defining examples for a live programming environment.

Live programming environments are development environments where feedback on execution of the program is constantly being given to the programmer, and updated as the source code changes. Which part of the execution to track and showcase to the programmer can be defined by *examples*.

This language is currently evolving along with the [LiveRec project](https://github.com/jbdoderlein/LiveProbes/tree/LivEx) which it uses as an execution back-end. However, the language is intended to be usable for any live programming execution environment.
